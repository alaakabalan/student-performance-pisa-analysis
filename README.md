# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

This project analyzes student data to predict their final grades using machine learning. It explores how factors like study time, absences, and past scores affect outcomes.

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: UCI / Kaggle educational dataset
- Focus: Math course performance

## 🔍 Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**
2. **Visual Analysis**
3. **Linear Regression**
4. **Random Forest Modeling**
5. **Model Evaluation (R², RMSE)**

## 🧠 Results

- R² Score: **0.86**
- RMSE: **1.7**

## 📦 Tools Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Add more features (e.g., school support)
- Test classification models (e.g., pass/fail prediction)
- Deploy as a simple app (optional)
